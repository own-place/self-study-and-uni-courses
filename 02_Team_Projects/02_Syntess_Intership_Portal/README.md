# 🌐 Web-based Syntess Internship Management Portal

Welcome to our Framework Development project that creates a prototype of a Web-based Internship Management Portal in collaboration with the largest software company in Zeeland and the market leader EPR-software for installation companies - Syntess! This web-based platform's objective is to streamline the process of managing internships, making it easier for both Syntess and potential interns to connect and collaborate. 🚀

## 🎯 Project Vision

Our goal is to create an intuitive, user-friendly portal that facilitates the application, tracking, and management of internships at Syntess. We aim to simplify the process for both interns and the Syntess team, ensuring a smooth and productive internship experience. 🌟 We also are thriving to learn about project and framework development along the way.

## 📋 Planned Features

- **Internship Listings:** Browse and apply for internships tailored to your skills and interests. 📚
- **Application Tracking:** Monitor the status of your applications from submission to decision. 📈
- **Intern Profiles:** Create and manage your profile to showcase your skills and experiences. 🙍‍♂️
- **Mentorship:** Allow mentors to log in the portal, update documents and internships, create new ones, and follow their interns. 🙍‍♀️

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🎨
- **Backend:** PHP, Laravel 🖥️
- **Database:** MySQL🗄️

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
3. Install composer
```sh
composer install
```
4. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
5. Ensure your connection with the database is on point (you need to manually create a database with the name 'portal' in MySQL). Then you need to run the migrations and seeders, either from the browser itself, or in the terminal using the command `php artisan migrate --seed`.
6. Start the project
```sh
php artisan serve
```
```sh
npm run dev
```
And keep in mind you have to have MySQL from XAMPP running.
